# 2D-Fourier-imaging
This is the code package for magnetic Fourier imaging with NV ensemble in 2D case. It entails the uniform analysis of the reconstruction method and the non-uniform case as well. This code is wirtrn by Ke-Hang Zhu. And the idea is under the discussion with Ruolan Xue, Mark Ku and Professor Amir Yacoby in Harvard.
